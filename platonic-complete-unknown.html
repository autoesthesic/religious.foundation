    <h2>Platonic Complete Unknown</h2>
    <h3>My Reading of the Film</h3>
    <p>So I just watched the new Bob Dylan movie <i>A Complete Unknown</i>, and
    I have to say I think it came out really Platonic. I don't necessarily want
    to assume anyone behind it was like purposefully imbuing it with the vibes of
    Plato, but there's something about it and I just can quite put my finger on
    it.</p>
    <p>The first thing that got the gears turning was the mysteriousness of Bob
    Dylan. The film doesn't give us the audience any context before he appears and
    goes to find Woody Guthrie. Bob seems to avoid talking about his past, except
    for his mysterious and vague connection to the carnival. He seems to disconnect
    his identity from his experiences, and contrasts this with the people around
    him. When Joan Baez asks where he learned to play, it's only when pressed that
    he acknowledges he learned from people at the carnival. On the other hand, she
    readily expresses that she had been formally trained. For Bob, his having learned
    to be a musician is a mere fact, not relevant to his being a musician, while
    for Joan, her being a musician is intimately connected with her having learned
    to be a musician. While this may seem like a fine line to be drawing, to me,
    it's highlighting a Platonic idea of Soul. Bob Dylan is distinguishing between
    his material identity, based off his life experiences and actions, and his actual
    identity, an intangible and unknowable soul ultimately modeled after The Soul.</p>
    <p>So what's the deal with The Soul here? At one point, Bob affirms to Silvie
    that he believes he's god. While this is presented as a joke, there is clearly
    truth here. Plato relates that the souls of all beings are hypostases of The
    Soul. The universe is supposed to be powered by The One, which emanates The
    Intelligence, which emanates The Soul. And likewise, in all beings is some level
    of one, intelligence, and soul. And while we do surround ourselves with more
    identity than that, everything beyond that is material and ephemeral. When Bob
    identifies himself as god, he is identifying himself as the fixed being within
    him, which is literally god, made in the image of The One.</p>
    <p>This is supported by his creativity. I mean first not his music but simply
    everything he does which identifies the power within. He is constantly doing
    things which imply denial of ephemeral identity in favor of fixed identity.
    The film seems to be pushing us to believe Bob is enlightened, in a way, having
    successfully stripped himself of any material "soul", before even the events
    of the film. The film isn't telling the story of a person identifying himself
    as one, it's telling the story of one emulating The One. That's what his music
    is an expression of.</p>
    <p>Just as The One emanates The Intelligence, Bob Dylan emanates music. Music
    is his expression of Platonic intellect. Partly, this is revealed by how incapable
    he seems to be of limiting it. The One produces The Intelligence not by choice
    but by virtue of its sheer Oneness. Likewise, Bob, in having become enlightened,
    is now incapable of not producing intellect in the form of music. There are
    two levels to this. One, is that he can't stop writing even when it's not socially
    acceptable to write. Second, is that he refuses to play old music when he has
    new music to play. So Bob emulates The One by emanating music emulating The
    Intelligence, but it goes further. Just as The Intelligence emanates The Soul,
    Bob's music emanates a kind of soul in the people who listen to it. Bob's career
    languishes until he finally plays his own music, which immediately rockets him
    to fame. That "fame" is an expression of the soul, cultivated in the people
    of America through the intellect of his music.</p>
    <p>Plato relates that the relationship between The One and The Intellect is
    the sum of all relationships between the expansion of the point to the circle,
    and that this is also the level of relationship between The Intellect and The
    Soul. Just as the circle is both a simple emanation of its center but also infinitely
    more complex in so many different ways, each level of emanation of The One both
    totally represents the essence of The One and is also totally different from
    it. We can find parallels to Bob Dylan here. Bob's music is totally different
    from Bob &mdash; he is a person, while it is not &mdash; but it is also clearly
    an emanation representative of him. Likewise, Bob's music's effect on America
    is totally different from Bob's music &mdash; it is an effect, while the music
    is not &mdash; but it is clearly an emanation representative of the music, which
    is representative of Bob Dylan, who is ultimately representative of The One.</p>
    <h3>My Other Reading</h3>
    <p>Now I think just the above alone leaves some issues unresolved. One, how
    does this relate to Bob Dylan's being an asshole and stuff? At best he comes
    off as a mere esoteric egotist, and at worst he actively hurts the people around
    him by pushing an artistic ethos that he won't explain. Second, how does this
    relate to his desires? He is not a mystic with magical powers attained by contemplation
    of The One, or at least not apparently so. He doesn't seem to be free from desire
    or ephemeral identity. Why does he produce music, rather than simply isolate
    himself and philosophize? Why does he become famous? Is it by choice?</p>
    <p>Bob Dylan is clearly a misanthrope. He reminds me of Dr. Gregory House in
    his inability to reconcile himself to humanity. With Dr. House, he excuses his
    misanthropy because of his skill as a doctor. Because he is the best doctor,
    he seems to argue, he doesn't need to be a good person in other respects. Maybe
    he doesn't have the energy, or his genius makes up for his other deficits. I
    think Bob is making a similar implicit argument. Because he is the best musician,
    because of his closeness to The One, he doesn't need to worry about other people.
    The film provides conflicting evidence to the righteousness of this viewpoint.
    In favor of it, one could argue that because Bob so actively emulates The One,
    he highlights the human ability to grow closer to the one and does his best
    to encourage his audience to do so. Further, his audience fails to recognize
    this message, losing themselves in the soul emanated through his music and not
    drawing connections higher up the chain. In doing so, they fail to utilize their
    intellect to his level, which cripples their ability to utilize their oneness.
    But just as easily as you could blame the people could you blame Bob Dylan.
    The people before Bob weren't thinking about The One, and if after Bob they
    aren't thinking about The One, then that isn't a failure of them to recognize
    his message, it's a failure of him to communicate effectively. This is the basic
    problem of misanthropy, recognized by the Buddha. To only contemplate your own
    oneness is an egotistical pursuit, driven either by a failure to recognize or
    an active rejection of the oneness inherent to all beings. This is why we can
    simultaneously identify the philosophical form of Bob Dylan, as well as reject
    him at least for failing to recognize The One through any other channel but
    his own.</p>
    <p>Bob Dylan also does seem to express desires which contradict his apparent
    striving for oneness. For example, his cheating on Silvie with Joan, basically
    every time he's left alone, and then his repeated appearance in both of their
    lives after what should have been a conclusion to their relationships. Again
    and again Bob goes to great lengths to find some degree of human connection.
    But in each case there is always some degree of failure to even identify what
    he wants out of his relationships and failure to recognize what his partner
    needs from him. In that respect, Bob seems to be rejecting the notion that he
    has desire, thus enabling it, rather than accepting that he's a creature of
    desire in order to effectively manage it. On top of that, by allowing himself
    to feel desire without contemplating it, Bob is denying himself a more complete
    degree of self-control. So he's only really emulating aspects of The One, rather
    than fully uniting with it.</p>
    <h3>Reality and Conclusions</h3>
    <p>Looking at his Wikipedia article, it seems Bob Dylan has made conflicting
    statements on his philosophical and theological beliefs. He was born Jewish,
    with a Jewish name, and he is a Bar Mitzvah, meaning that he has at least some
    foundation of Jewish thought. He has at times made statements accepting Christian
    texts and theology, but he has also claimed either to have gone back on these
    beliefs or not to believe in any organized religion whatsoever. In one 1997
    interview, he said, "The songs are my lexicon." He said in 2004, "The only person
    you have to think twice about lying to is either yourself or to God." Particularly
    interesting to me is something about his music being part of a bargain with
    "the chief commander." I read out of all this someone who has a very Platonic
    conception of god, who recognizes that his beliefs aren't wholly represented
    by the religions as he understands them. Of course I'm not asserting that Bob
    has studied Plato or anything like that. Any good philosophy will naturally
    express itself through reality, and I think Bob is a great example of that.</p>
    <p>The One clearly shines through in <i>A Complete Unknown</i>, and I don't
    think it's by accident. I think that what I read as Bob Dylan's natural inclination
    towards Platonic thought has created a similar inclination. I haven't actually
    checked but I'm pretty sure they didn't hire Plato or anything to consult on
    the script or any of the shots or anything like that, but it goes to show you
    don't really need Plato to be Platonic.</p>
    <p>And while The One definitely shines through, so do the complexities of the
    human relationship with it. I think a perfect reading of the movie wouldn't
    excessively praise or criticize Bob. It's a very compelling example of how hard
    it is to fully realize your identity. I see a bit of a tendency to think of
    Bob Dylan as fundamentally different from other people. Film Bob himself says
    he hopes to be a freak, in that to be famous one must be different and interesting.
    But the truth is that we all struggle with the same Platonic identity conflict
    that Bob does. It's a key part of the human condition, the question of what
    is the true essence of our identity. The thing is, none of us really have the
    full knowledge of what to do and when or how to act and so on. We are not The
    One. We can get at it and think about it but we are many degrees removed from
    it and life doesn't come with a convenient easy instruction manual. Bob Dylan
    certainly didn't have one! I believe in the distinction between a misstep and
    a mistake. You can only get so far considering how someone else could have been
    better, and to me, the key takeaway from this film is how I myself can be better.
    In The Way of the Samurai, one should be able to study all other ways and only
    better realize their own way. I think that is key to understanding Bob Dylan
    and how we can properly derive messages from this film.</p>
