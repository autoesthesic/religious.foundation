    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Preface: I have no clue how best to digitize the letterforms themselves, so for the time being, this is just a geometrical/structural overview of what they mean. That having been said:</p>
    <p>I have image problems with the way English is written. It's not the usual "English spelling is so weird!" &mdash; I love the weird, that's great. My problems are (1) the <i>way</i> it's weird is unpredictable, (2) the way it's weird is aesthetically unsound, (3) it's not holy enough. No, really, like, we <i>know</i> the Latin script is descended from hieroglyphs, which were called "ἱερός" because the Egyptians took that stuff seriously. But somehow, along the line, we've lost all the holy bits and now reading and writing's just this dumb thing we have to do to communicate these days.</p>
    <p>My script is based on Phoenician: for the first 22 letters, I've preserved the order and tried to assign sounds based off of approximate knowledge of their original values. Of course, I don't really know what all the letters meant at the time and I can't really go back and ask anybody, but it seemed to me like I could get a pretty reasonable setup by looking at how the others, particularly the Greeks and the modern descendents of the Semitic languages, interpreted or evolved values of the script.</p>
    <p>Now, I haven't fully settled on digraphs and trigraphs, but trust me, they're out there &mdash; at least for the vowels. See, the dream, the vision, is a return to the classics: short [a e i o u], long [ā ē ī ō ū], consonants [ĭ ŭ]. And phonemically, by some sort of divine providence, or something, these all fit! The catch is that phonologically, it doesn't really. For example, in my accent, words can end with /ə/ but not with any of /æ ɛ ɪ ʊ/. Another example is how vowel sounds mutate before consonants, especially /r/. Oops &mdash; schwa is special again. Or how about how consonants [ĭ ŭ] can precede <i>any</i> vowel, <i>including</i> the vowels [i ī u ū] spelled with the same letters. So yeah, before I go on about how my accent of English isn't as "geometrically perfect" as I wish, I'll just assume it's clear that there's a lot of fudging I need to do to get everything to at least <i>look</i> as geometrically perfect as I want.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>This is the way my instincts "naively" tell me to spell things. I think there's enough here for a determined reader to extrapolate problems.</p>
    <p><i>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</i></p>

    <h3>...</h3>
    <p>So to wrap things up, expect that sometime in the next 100+ years I'll come up with some genius solutions to all these problems while keeping with those first three goals. Blah blah blah. If I remember I made this site then I'll publish it on here, too.</p>
    <p>Oh, also, diacritics???</p>
