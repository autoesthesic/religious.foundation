    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I study philosophy in college. I know the secret teaching of Socrates, and
    also Maimonides.</p>
    <p>I have many hobbies, but mostly it's just me thinking about different things.
    I think most people expect hobbies to produce something kind of lasting. I think
    I'm also doing that, if you count thoughts or like forms as lasting things,
    which I do, but I do feel bad that I can't look at them.</p>
    <p>Since most of my hobbies are just thinking about things, I should be able
    to get closer to my form of The Hobby by thinking about thinking about things,
    which is what this website is. If I just keep publishing whatever I think is
    worth publishing, then over time I should have a good progression of thoughts
    all in one place for me.</p>
    <p>I'm pretty sure the first problem I'll run into is the question of what is
    worth publishing. I don't think all of my thoughts are very good but I also
    want to be as accurate as possible. I'm also afraid I'll over or under represent
    some interest of mine and then only later realize what the true interest was
    behind that. Right now I don't really necessarily know what all my interests
    are, so it's basically random which one will be for example the first thing
    I write about. But then I can't let that become the only thing.</p>
    <p>Another concern is whether this is worthwhile at all. It's definitely fun
    for me. But why am I putting it on a website? I already have a journal. Am I
    saying that's not enough? Why am I calling it Religious Foundation? It does
    seem pretty egotistical.</p>
