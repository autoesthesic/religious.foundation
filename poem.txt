"Ultimate Ego"
A] So Person A, not the main character, is stuck in a time loop,
   yknow, like they're doing the same day over and over. But really
   Person B is the main character, so Person B, whose perspective is
   the story's, just sees Person A having a pretty weird day. And the
   idea is that this is actually a pretty minor event, chronologically,
   in the story, so most of the story can kinda be a reaction to it.
B] Okay that does sound cool but I don't really get what it means with all the
   perspectives.
A] What, like why Person A isn't the main character?
B] Yeah. Isn't the story about them?
A] No like it's supposed to highlight the fact that like okay from their
   perspective, because they're in the time loop they're totally the main
   character, but for anyone else, like Person B as example, time is still
   linear, so it just kinda happens and then other stuff happens, so isn't
   it a kinda egotistical for Person A to be so caught up with their loop thing?
B] Oh, okay.
   But isn't it normal to think that way, like in a time loop? I mean it's a
   pretty serious thing to be stuck in. Like are you saying it'd be bad for
   someone who's like, severely injured and needs immediate help, to focus
   on their problem?
A] But yknow like don't put words in my mouth. I said egotistical, and maybe
   that's different than bad.
B] Okay. So what are you saying?
A] I don't know.
